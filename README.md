### Projects Overview
#### 1. Part of Speech Tagging with Hidden Markov Model 
Part of speech tagging has been used for many NLP tasks like determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis, for information retrieval, and for word sense disambiguation.
This project implemented a Hidden Markov Model step by step for part of speech tagging with the Pomegranate library and achieved 96% accuracy in predicting POS tags. 
Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.

#### 2. Machine Translation
In this project, I built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline with Keras. The pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. 
Four different RNN models have been built in the notebook - simple model using only GRU, word embedding + LSTM, encoder-decoder and Bidirectional RNN. The final model achieved 96% tranlation accuracy with the combination of word embedding and Bidirectional RNN.
